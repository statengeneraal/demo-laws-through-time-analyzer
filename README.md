Laws Through Time
=================

This repo is an example application of the [XML](https://github.com/statengeneraal/laws-xml) and [Markdown law repositories](https://github.com/statengeneraal/laws-markdown). It loops through textual changes (non-whitespace) in the Markdown repository and puts the numbers of added, modified and deleted texts per day into a table.

Note that the repositories only start tracking law modifications since ~2010, so additions before that time may actually be modifications from earlier expressions.

Additional information will follow once the law repositories are populated.
